## Motivation

Searching documentation is a constant need but not an easy task. Switch contexts between your code editor to the browser, remember the documentation site url and then find what you need. Many times, I kwew exactly what I want to find and that I have seen before, but simple cant find it again.

This extension, aims to make documentation search less painfull, allowing you to a full text search on popular documentation sites directly from directly from ulauncher.
